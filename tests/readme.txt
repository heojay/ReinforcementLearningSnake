Unit tests using pytest


pytest --version   # shows where pytest was imported from
pytest --fixtures  # show available builtin function arguments
pytest -h | --help # show help on command line and config file options

To change the test directory, use vs code command configure tests


To import modules from tests, it is easiest and recommended to place tests
in the same package as modules being tested.
